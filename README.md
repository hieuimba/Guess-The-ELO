## Description
Guess the Elo is a chess-based game that challenges your ability to assess player skill levels. Can you accurately guess the Elo rating of a chess match just by watching the moves?

## How It Works
- Each round presents you with a random chess game from Lichess 
- Choose from four options to guess the correct Elo rating 
- Earn points for accurate guesses
- Challenge yourself in two game modes:
  - Classic: Aim for the highest score across a set number of rounds
  - Endless: See how long you can survive with 3 lives.

## Note
- Elo ratings from Lichess start at 1500, following the Glicko system definition.
- Thousands of chess games are sourced from Lichess every month to ensure game variety and relevance. If you're interested in how that works, check out the data pipeline for this game here: https://github.com/hieuimba/Lichess-Spark-DataPipeline

Have fun!
