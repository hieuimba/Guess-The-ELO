## Description

Guess the Elo is a casual quiz game where you guess the Elo rating of a chess match. Test your chess knowledge and intuition by earning the most points across rounds or by surviving the longest in Endless mode!

## How To Play

- Each round presents you with a random chess game along with four Elo ratings for that match.
- Guess the correct Elo rating to earn points.
- Challenge yourself in two game modes:
  - Classic: Aim for the highest score across a set number of rounds.
  - Endless: Start with 3 lives and try to survive as long as possible. Earn additional lives with correct guesses.

Have fun!

Note: All Elo ratings are from Lichess, which starts at 1500.

## Data Source

Guess the Elo sources a large collection of games from Lichess every month to ensure that games are always diverse and up-to-date. If you're interested in how that works, check out the data pipeline for this game here: https://github.com/hieuimba/Lichess-Spark-DataPipeline
