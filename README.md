## Description
Guess the Elo is a game where you can test your chess knowledge and intuition by guessing the Elo rating of a chess match.

## How It Works
- Each round presents you with a random chess game from Lichess 
- Choose from four options to guess the correct Elo rating 
- Earn points for accurate guesses
- Challenge yourself in two game modes:
  - Classic: Aim for the highest score across a set number of rounds
  - Endless: See how long you can survive with 3 lives.

## Note
- Elo ratings from Lichess start at 1500, following the Glicko system definition.
- Guess the Elo sources a large collection of games from Lichess every month to ensure game variety and relevance. If you're interested in how that works, check out the data pipeline for this game here: https://github.com/hieuimba/Lichess-Spark-DataPipeline

Have fun!
