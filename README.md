## Description
Guess the Elo is a game where you test your chess skills by guessing the rating (Elo) of a chess match. Each game consists of several rounds where you will be presented with a random chess game. Select from four choices to guess the correct Elo for that match.

Challenge yourself by earning the most points across all rounds or by surviving the longest in Endless mode!

Elo ratings for all games are collected from Lichess, which starts at 1500.

Guess the Elo sources a large collection of games from Lichess every month to ensure game variety and relevance. If you're interested in how that works, check out the data pipeline for this game here: https://github.com/hieuimba/Lichess-Spark-DataPipeline

Have fun!
