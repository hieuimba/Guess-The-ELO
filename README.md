# Guess-The-ELO
Guess the Elo is a game where you guess the rating (Elo) of a given chess game.

Test your chess knowledge and intuition by earning the most points across all rounds or surviving the longest in endless mode!

Challenge yourself further with the Hard difficulty, where the evaluation bar is removed, and you have less time for each guess.

**Elo ratings for all games are collected from Lichess, which starts at 1500, following the Glicko system definition

Have fun!
