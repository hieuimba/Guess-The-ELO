## Styles

### SCSS (recommended)

If you use [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/), you can import the styles with:
```scss
@import '../../node_modules/lichess-pgn-viewer/scss/lichess-pgn-viewer.lib';
```
Customisable SCSS variables are [available](https://github.com/lichess-org/pgn-viewer/blob/master/scss/_lichess-pgn-viewer.lib.scss), see [how lichess configures lichess-pgn-viewer with SCSS](https://github.com/lichess-org/lila/blob/master/ui/common/css/component/_lichess-pgn-viewer.scss).

### CSS

Alternatively you can build a CSS file with
```sh
npm run sass-prod
```
Then copy the `dist/lichess-pgn-viewer.css` file into your project.
